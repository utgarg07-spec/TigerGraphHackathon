## Overview

![GraphRAG Overview](./docs/img/TG-GraphRAG-Overview.png)

TigerGraph GraphRAG is an AI assistant that is meticulously designed to combine the powers of vector store, graph databases and generative AI to draw the most value from data and to enhance productivity across various business functions, including analytics, development, and administration tasks. It is one AI assistant with two core component services:
* A natural language assistant for Q&A with graph-powered solutions
* A knowledge graph builder for managing documents and graphs

You can interact with GraphRAG through the built-in chat interface and APIs. For now, your own LLM services (from OpenAI, Azure, GCP, AWS Bedrock, Ollama, Hugging Face and Groq.) are required to use GraphRAG, but in future releases you can use TigerGraph’s LLMs.

### Nature Language Query
![Nature Language Query](./docs/img/NatureLanguageQuery-Architecture.png)

When a question is posed in natural language, GraphRAG employs a novel three-phase interaction with both the TigerGraph database and a LLM of the user's choice, to obtain accurate and relevant responses.

The first phase aligns the question with the particular data available in the database. GraphRAG uses the LLM to compare the question with the graph’s schema and replace entities in the question by graph elements. For example, if there is a vertex type of `BareMetalNode` and the user asks `How many servers are there?`, the question will be translated to `How many BareMetalNode vertices are there?`. In the second phase, GraphRAG uses the LLM to compare the transformed question with a set of curated database queries and functions in order to select the best match. In the third phase, GraphRAG executes the identified query and returns the result in natural language along with the reasoning behind the actions.

Using pre-approved queries provides multiple benefits. First and foremost, it reduces the likelihood of hallucinations, because the meaning and behavior of each query has been validated.  Second, the system has the potential of predicting the execution resources needed to answer the question.

### Knowledge Graph Query
![Knowledge Graph Query](./docs/img/GraphRAG-Architecture.png)

For inquiries cannot be answered with structured graph data, GraphRAG employs an AI chatbots with graph-augmented Knowledge Graph based on a user's own documents or text data. It builds a knowledge graph from source material and applies its unique variant of knowledge graph-based RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to improve the contextual relevance and accuracy of answers to natural-language questions.

GraphRAG will also identify concepts and build an ontology, to add semantics and reasoning to the knowledge graph, or users can provide their own concept ontology. Then, with this comprehensive knowledge graph, GraphRAG performs hybrid retrievals, combining traditional vector search and graph traversals, to collect more relevant information and richer context to answer users’ knowledge questions.

Organizing the data as a knowledge graph allows a chatbot to access accurate, fact-based information quickly and efficiently, thereby reducing the reliance on generating responses from patterns learned during training, which can sometimes be incorrect or out of date.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Docker + Docker Compose Plugin, or Kubernetes
* TigerGraph DB 4.2+.
* API key of your LLM provider. (An LLM provider refers to a company or organization that offers Large Language Models (LLMs) as a service. The API key verifies the identity of the requester, ensuring that the request is coming from a registered and authorized user or application.) Currently, GraphRAG supports the following LLM providers: OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, GCP, AWS Bedrock.


### Quick Start

#### Use TigerGraph Docker-Based Instance
Set your LLM Provider (supported `openai` or `gemini`) api key as environment variable LLM_API_KEY and use the following command for a one-step quick deployment with TigerGraph Community Edition and default configurations:
```
curl -k https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tigergraph/graphrag/refs/heads/main/docs/tutorials/setup_graphrag.sh | bash
```

The GraphRAG instances will be deployed at `./graphrag` folder and TigerGraph instance will be available at `http://localhost:14240`.
To change installation folder, use `bash -s -- <graphrag_folder> <llm_provider>` instead of `bash` at the end of the above command.

> Note: for other LLM providers, manually update `configs/server_config.json` accordingly and re-run `docker compose up -d`

#### Use Pre-Installed TigerGraph Instance
Similar to the above setup, and use the following command for a one-step quick deployment connecting to a pre-installed TigerGraph with default configurations:
```
curl -k https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tigergraph/graphrag/refs/heads/main/docs/tutorials/setup_graphrag_tg.sh | bash
```

The GraphRAG instances will be deployed at `./graphrag` folder and connect to TigerGraph instance at `http://localhost:14240` by default.
To change installation folder, TigerGraph instance location or username/password, use `bash -s -- <graphrag_folder> <llm_provider> <tg_host> <tg_port> <tg_username> <tg_password>` instead of `bash` at the end of the above command.

### Deploy GraphRAG Manually
The GraphRAG services can be deployed manually using Docker Compose or Kubernetes with updated configurations for different use cases.

#### Manual Deploy of GraphRAG with Docker Compose

##### Step 1: Get docker-compose file
Download the [docker-compose.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tigergraph/graphrag/refs/heads/main/docs/tutorials/docker-compose.yml) file directly

The Docker Compose file contains all dependencies for GraphRAG including a TigerGraph database. If you want to use a separate TigerGraph instance, you can comment out the `tigergraph` section from the docker compose file and restart all services. However, please follow the instructions below to make sure your standalone TigerGraph server is accessible from other GraphRAG containers.

##### Step 2: Set up configurations

Next, download the following configuration files and put them in a `configs` subdirectory of the directory contains the Docker Compose file:
* [configs/server_config.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tigergraph/graphrag/refs/heads/main/docs/tutorials/configs/server_config.json)
* [configs/nginx.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tigergraph/graphrag/refs/heads/main/docs/tutorials/configs/nginx.conf)

Here’s what the folder structure looks like:
```
    graphrag
    ├── configs
    │   ├── nginx.conf
    │   └── server_config.json
    └── docker-compose.yml
```

##### Step 3: Adjust configurations

Edit `llm_config` section of `configs/server_config.json` and replace `<YOUR_LLM_API_KEY>` to your own LLM_API_KEY for the LLM provider. 
 
> If desired, you can also change the model to be used for the embedding service and completion service to your preferred models to adjust the output from the LLM service.

##### Step 4: Configure Logging Level in Dockerfile (Optional)

To configure the logging level of the service, edit the Docker Compose file.

**By default, the logging level is set to "INFO".**

```console
ENV LOGLEVEL="INFO"
```

This line can be changed to support different logging levels.

**The levels are described below:**

| Level | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `CRITICAL` | A serious error. |
| `ERROR` | Failing to perform functions. |
| `WARNING` | Indication of unexpected problems, e.g. failure to map a user’s question to the graph schema. |
| `INFO` | Confirming that the service is performing as expected. |
| `DEBUG` | Detailed information, e.g. the functions retrieved during the `GenerateFunction` step, etc. |
| `DEBUG_PII` | Finer-grained information that could potentially include `PII`, such as a user’s question, the complete function call (with parameters), and the LLM’s natural language response. |
| NOTSET | All messages are processed. |

##### Step 5: Start all services

Now, simply run `docker compose up -d` and wait for all the services to start.

> Note: `graphrag` container will be down if TigerGraph service is not ready. Log into the `tigergraph` container, bring up tigergraph services and rerun `docker compose up -d` should resolve the issue.

##### Step 6: Stop all services (when needed)

Run command `docker compose down` and wait for all the service containers to stopped and removed.

[Go back to top](#top)

#### Use Standalone TigerGraph instance (If preferred)

> **_Note:_** Vector feature is available in both TigerGraph Community Edition 4.2.0+ and Enterprise Edition 4.2.0+.

If you prefer to start a TigerGraph Community Edition instance without a license key, please make sure the container can be accessed from the GraphRAG containers by add `--network graphrag_default`:
```
docker run -d -p 14240:14240 --name tigergraph --ulimit nofile=1000000:1000000 --init --network graphrag_default -t tigergraph/community:4.2.2
```

> Use **tigergraph/tigergraph:4.2.2** if Enterprise Edition is preferred.
> Setting up **DNS** or `/etc/hosts` properly is an alternative solution to ensure contains can connect to each other.
> Or modify`hostname` in `db_config` section of `configs/server_config.json` and replace `http://tigergraph` to your tigergraph container IP address, e.g., `http://172.19.0.2`. 

Check the service status with the following commands:
```
docker exec -it tigergraph /bin/bash
gadmin status
gadmin start all
```

After using the database, and you want to shutdown it, use the following shell commmand
```
gadmin stop all
```

#### Manual Deploy of GraphRAG with Kubernetes

##### Step 1: Get kubernetes deployment file
  Download the [graphrag-k8s.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tigergraph/graphrag/refs/heads/main/docs/tutorials/graphrag-k8s.yml) file directly

##### Step 2: Modify `graphrag-k8s.yml` (Optional)
  Remove the sections for tigergraph instance if you're using a standalone TigerGraph instance instead

##### Step 3: Set up server configurations
  Next, in the same directory as the Kubernetes deployment file is in, create a `configs` directory and download the following configuration files:
  * [configs/server_config.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tigergraph/graphrag/refs/heads/main/docs/tutorials/configs/server_config.json)

  Update the TigerGraph database information, LLM API keys and other configs accordingly.

##### Step 4: Install Nginx Ingress (Optional)
  If Nginx Ingress is not installed yet, it can be installed using `kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.2.1/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml`

##### Step 5: Start all services
  Replace `/path/to/graphrag/configs` with the absolute path of the `configs` folder inside `graphrag-k8s.yml`, and update the TigerGraph database information and other configs accordingly.

  Now, simply run `kubectl apply -f graphrag-k8s.yml` and wait for all the services to start.

##### Step 6: Stop all services (Optional)
  Run kubectl delete -f graphrag-k8s.yml and wait for all the services in the deployment to be deleted.

> Note: Nginx Ingress should be deleted using kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.2.1/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml if port 80 needs to be released

## Use TigerGraph GraphRAG

GraphRAG is friendly to both technical and non-technical users. There is a graphical chat interface as well as API access to GraphRAG. Function-wise, GraphRAG can answer your questions by calling existing queries in the database, build a knowledge graph from your documents, and answer knowledge questions based on your documents.

### Run Demo with Preloaded GraphRAG

The pre-loaded knowledge graph `TigerGraphRAG` is provided for an express access to the GraphRAG features.

#### Step 1: Get data package

Download the following data file and put it under `/home/tigergraph/graphrag/` inside your TigerGraph container:
* [ExportedGraph.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tigergraph/graphrag/refs/heads/main/docs/data/ExportedGraph.zip)

Use the following commands if the file cannot be downloaded inside the TigerGraph container directly:
```
docker exec -it tigergraph mkdir -p /home/tigergraph/graphrag
docker exec -it tigergraph curl -kL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tigergraph/graphrag/refs/heads/main/docs/data/ExportedGraph.zip -o /home/tigergraph/graphrag/ExportedGraph.zip
```

> Note: command should be changed to equivalent formats if standalone TigerGraph instance is used

#### Step 2: Import data package
Next, log onto the TigerGraph instance and make use of the Database Import feature to recreate the GraphRAG:
```
docker exec -it tigergraph /bin/bash
gsql "import graph all from \"/home/tigergraph/graphrag\""
gsql "install query all"
```

Wait until the following output is given:
```
[======================================================================================================] 100% (26/26)
Query installation finished.
```

#### Step 3: Access Chatbot UI
Open your browser to access `http://localhost:<nginx_port>` to access GraphRAG Chat. For example: http://localhost:80

Enter the username and password of the TigerGraph database to login.

![Chat Login](./docs/img/ChatLogin.jpg)

On the top of the page, select `Classic` -> `Community Search` as RAG pattern and `TigerGraphRAG` as Graph.
![RAG Config](./docs/img/RAGConfig.jpg)

In the chat box, input the question `how to load data to tigergraph vector store, give an example in Python` and click the `send` button.
![Demo Question](./docs/img/DemoQuestion.jpg)

You can also ask other questions on statistics and data inside the TigerGraph database.
![Data          ](./docs/img/Inquiry.jpg)

[Go back to top](#top)


### Manually Build GraphRAG From Scratch

If you want to experience the whole process of GraphRAG, you can build the GraphRAG from scratch. However, please review the LLM model and service setting carefully because it will cost some money to re-generate embedding and data structure for the raw data.

#### Step 1: Get demo script

The following scripts are needed to run the demo. Please download and put them in the same directory `./graphrag` as the Docker Compose file:
* Demo driver: [graphrag_demo.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tigergraph/graphrag/refs/heads/main/docs/tutorials/graphrag_demo.sh)
* GraphRAG initializer: [init_graphrag.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tigergraph/graphrag/refs/heads/main/docs/tutorials/init_graphrag.py)
* Example: [answer_question.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tigergraph/graphrag/refs/heads/main/docs/tutorials/answer_question.py)

#### Step 2: Download the demo data

Next, download the following data file and put it in a `data` subdirectory of the directory contains the Docker Compose file:
* [data/tg_tutorials.jsonl](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tigergraph/graphrag/refs/heads/main/docs/data/tg_tutorials.jsonl)

#### Step 3: Run the demo driver script

> Note: Python 3.11+ is needed to run the demo

It is recommended to use a virtual env to isolate the runtime environment for the demo
```
python3.11 -m venv demo
source demo/bin/activate
```

Now, simply run the demo script to try GraphRAG.
```
  ./graphrag_demo.sh
```

The script will:
1. Check the environment
1. Init TigerGraph schema and related queries needed
1. Load the sample data
1. Init the GraphRAG based on the graph and install required queries
1. Ask a question via Python to get answer from GraphRAG

## Chat Engines and Agents

GraphRAG offers two chat engines, chosen from the chat menu (or set as a per-graph default via `agent_style`). The **Agentic** engine is the default and recommended engine; the **Classic** engine remains available for straightforward, predictable question-answering.

### Agentic

The agent decides its **own** retrieval instead of following a fixed pipeline: it picks which methods to use (structural graph queries, vector search, community search), can call external [MCP tools](#mcp-servers-agentic-tools), answers greetings and questions about itself directly, and cites the chunks and queries it used. It comes in two styles:

- **Planned** *(default)* — analyzes the question up front and lays out the whole retrieval plan (which methods, how many, in what order) as a small DAG, executes it, then synthesizes one grounded answer. Predictable and efficient; a strong fit for most questions, including multi-part ones.
- **Reactive** — reasons and acts one step at a time, deciding each next retrieval from what the previous step returned, and keeps going until it can answer completely and accurately. More adaptive to what it finds, at the cost of more steps (and tokens) on complex questions.

Both styles send trivial/conversational messages straight to a direct answer, and record their retrieval in the admin **Trace** — the plan/steps and reasoning, which chunks were retrieved, and which the agent selected for the answer.

**Selecting an engine.** In the chat UI, use the engine/style picker (Classic, or Agentic → Planned / Reactive). To set a per-graph default, configure `agent_style` (`auto` follows the configured default; `planned` or `reactive` force a style) — see [GraphRAG configuration](#graphrag-configuration). Depth is bounded by `agent_max_iterations` (Reactive) and `agent_max_replans` / `agent_max_total_steps` (Planned).

**Customizing agent behavior.** Each agentic style's retrieval strategy — and how messages are routed to a direct answer versus retrieval — is editable on the *Customize Prompts* page; see [§5 Prompts](#5-prompts--last-resort-biggest-leverage-when-the-rest-is-right).

### Classic

A fixed pipeline: it routes the question to a retrieval method (auto-selected or configured), retrieves supporting passages and graph context, and synthesizes the answer. Fast and predictable, and it always grounds answers in retrieved passages — a solid choice for straightforward question-answering.

## Document Ingestion for Knowledge Graph

Documents can be ingested into the knowledge graph either through the UI Admin page or manually via backend APIs.

> **Import Note**: Knowledge Graph needs to be initialized before document ingestion and should be refreshed after document ingestion to update graph content

![Document Processing Workflow](./docs/img/IngestionWorkflow.png)

### Ingest Documents from the UI

You can upload local files, download files from cloud storage, or use **Amazon Bedrock Data Automation (BDA)** as an external pre-processor for document ingestion.

#### Local File Upload

Local file ingestion follows a two-step process:

1. **Upload local files to the server**  
   Files are first uploaded to the GraphRAG server for pre-processing.  
   - Multimodal files (e.g., PDFs) are converted into text along with extracted images.  
   - Each image receives a generated description and a reference inside the converted text file.  
   - Uploaded files may be manually deleted before ingestion if they are no longer needed.

2. **Ingest files into your knowledge graph**  
   The pre-processed documents are loaded into the graph database as vertices using a dedicated ingestion job.

![Upload Files](./docs/img/LocalFileUpload.png)

#### Download from Cloud

Cloud ingestion works similarly to local uploads and also follows a two-step process:

1. **Download files from cloud storage**  
   Instead of selecting local files, you can connect to a cloud provider (S3, GCS, Azure) using the appropriate credentials.  
   - Files are downloaded to the GraphRAG server for pre-processing.  
   - Multimodal files (e.g., PDFs) are converted to text with extracted images, each with descriptive references.  
   - Downloaded files can be manually deleted before ingestion if no longer needed.

2. **Ingest files into your knowledge graph**  
   After pre-processing, the documents are loaded into the graph database as vertices via a dedicated ingestion job.

![Download from Cloud](./docs/img/DownloadFromCloud.png)

#### Use Amazon BDA

You may choose **Amazon Bedrock Data Automation (BDA)** as the external document pre-processor instead of the built-in GraphRAG processor.  
- Amazon BDA processes multimodal documents stored in an S3 bucket.  
- It writes the converted outputs to a separate S3 bucket.  
- These processed documents can then be ingested directly into your knowledge graph.  
- This method is a **single-step ingestion workflow** since pre-processing is completed by BDA.

![Use Amazon BDA](./docs/img/UseAmazonBDA.png)

### Ingest Documents via API

For examples of how to ingest documents through the backend API, refer to the **[GraphRAG Demo Notebook](./docs/notebooks/GraphRAGDemo.ipynb)**.

## More Detailed Configurations

### DB configuration
Copy the below into `configs/server_config.json` and edit the `hostname` to match your database's configuration. Token authentication is handled automatically — an api token is obtained from the username/password when the database requires one, unless a static api token is configured. Set the timeout, memory threshold, and thread limit parameters as desired to control how much of the database's resources are consumed when answering a question.

```json
{
    "db_config": {
        "hostname": "http://tigergraph",
        "restppPort": "9000",
        "gsPort": "14240",
        "username": "tigergraph",
        "password": "tigergraph",
        "default_timeout": 300,
        "default_mem_threshold": 5000,
        "default_thread_limit": 8
    }
}
```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `hostname` | string | `"http://tigergraph"` | TigerGraph server URL. |
| `restppPort` | string | `"9000"` | RESTPP port for TigerGraph API requests. |
| `gsPort` | string | `"14240"` | GSQL port for TigerGraph admin operations. |
| `username` | string | `"tigergraph"` | TigerGraph database username. |
| `password` | string | `"tigergraph"` | TigerGraph database password. |
| `graphname` | string | `""` | Default graph name. Usually left empty (selected at runtime). |
| `apiToken` | string | `""` | Optional pre-generated token for the service's background operations. Interactive requests always authenticate as the signed-in user. |
| `default_timeout` | int | `300` | Default query timeout in seconds. |
| `default_mem_threshold` | int | `5000` | Memory threshold (MB) for query execution. |
| `default_thread_limit` | int | `8` | Max threads for query execution. |

### GraphRAG configuration
Copy the below code into `configs/server_config.json`. You shouldn’t need to change anything unless you change the port of the chat history service in the Docker Compose file.

```json
{
    "graphrag_config": {
        "reuse_embedding": false,

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reuse_embedding` | bool | `true` | Reuse existing embeddings instead of regenerating them. |
| `ecc` | string | `"http://graphrag-ecc:8001"` | URL of the knowledge graph build service. No change needed when using the provided Docker Compose file. |
| `chat_history_api` | string | `"http://chat-history:8002"` | URL of the chat history service. No change needed when using the provided Docker Compose file. |
| `chunker` | string | `"semantic"` | Default document chunker. Options: `semantic`, `character`, `regex`, `markdown`, `html`, `recursive`. |
| `extractor` | string | `"llm"` | Entity extraction method. Use `llm` (schema-aware, recommended). `graphrag` is **deprecated** and will be removed in a future release. |
| `strict_mode` | bool | `false` | Dynamic-schema enforcement during extraction. When `true`, entities and relationships that don't match the domain schema are dropped. When `false` (default), unmatched nodes fall back to generic `Entity` vertices. |
| `retrieval_include_entity` | bool \| null | `null` (auto) | Whether retriever queries include the generic `Entity` vertex alongside domain types. When unset, the server uses `false` if a domain schema exists and `true` otherwise. Set explicitly to override. |
| `schema_max_sample_files` | int | `5` | Maximum number of sample documents accepted by the *Generate from sample documents* path on the *Initialize Knowledge Graph* dialog. |
| `schema_max_total_mb` | int | `50` | Combined upload cap (MB) across all sample files for schema extraction. Bounds the content sent to the LLM. A single file may use the full budget; no separate per-file cap. |
| `enable_router_fallback` | bool | `true` | When a structured query returns no result, fall back to vector search instead of failing the query. Applies to the classic engine (after the function-call or Cypher path fails its retries) and to the planned agent (when a structural query returns no rows). |
| `chunker_config` | object | `{}` | Chunker-specific settings (see sub-parameters below). All settings are saved regardless of which chunker is selected as default. |
| ↳ `chunk_size` | int | `2048` | Maximum number of characters per chunk. Used by `character`, `markdown`, `html`, and `recursive` chunkers. Larger values produce fewer, bigger chunks; smaller values produce more, finer-grained chunks. |
| ↳ `overlap_size` | int | 1/8 of `chunk_size` | Number of overlapping characters between consecutive chunks. Used by `character`, `markdown`, `html`, and `recursive` chunkers. More overlap preserves cross-chunk context but increases total chunk count. Set to `0` for no overlap. |
| ↳ `method` | string | `"percentile"` | Breakpoint detection method for the `semantic` chunker. Options: `percentile`, `standard_deviation`, `interquartile`, `gradient`. Controls how the chunker decides where to split based on embedding similarity. |
| ↳ `threshold` | float | `0.95` | Similarity threshold for the `semantic` chunker. Higher values produce more splits (smaller chunks); lower values produce fewer splits (larger chunks). |
| ↳ `pattern` | string | `""` | Regular expression pattern for the `regex` chunker. The document is split at each match of this pattern. |
| `top_k` | int | `5` | Number of initial seed results to retrieve per search. Also caps the final scored results. Increasing `top_k` increases the overall context size sent to the LLM. |
| `num_hops` | int | `2` | Number of graph hops to traverse from seed nodes during hybrid search. More hops expand the result set with related context. |
| `num_seen_min` | int | `2` | Minimum occurrence count for a node to be included during hybrid search traversal. Higher values filter out loosely connected nodes, reducing context size. |
| `max_results` | int | `2 × top_k` | Caps the number of result chunks hybrid and community search return, ranked by relevance to the question, instead of every chunk the expansion (or community membership) reaches. When unset it is twice `top_k`, which is also the minimum; set higher to return more context. Lowering it reduces the context sent to the LLM. |
| `community_level` | int | `2` | Community hierarchy level for community search. Higher levels retrieve broader, higher-order community summaries. |
| `agent_style` | string | `"planned"` | Default agentic engine style: `"planned"` (plan the whole retrieval up front) or `"reactive"` (decide each step from the last result). The chat menu can override per request. See [Chat Engines and Agents](#chat-engines-and-agents). |
| `agent_max_iterations` | int | `30` | Reactive agent only: maximum reason-act-observe steps before it must answer. |
| `agent_max_replans` | int | `3` | Planned agent only: how many times the planner may extend its plan when the gathered context is insufficient. |
| `agent_max_total_steps` | int | `20` | Planned agent only: hard cap on executed retrieval steps across all replans. |
| `chunk_only` | bool | `true` | If true, hybrid search only retrieves document chunks, excluding entity data. |
| `doc_only` | bool | `false` | If true, hybrid search retrieves whole documents instead of chunks. Significantly increases context size. |
| `with_chunk` | bool | `true` | If true, community search also includes document chunks alongside community summaries. Increases context size. |
| `doc_process_switch` | bool | `true` | Enable/disable document processing during knowledge graph build. |
| `entity_extraction_switch` | bool | same as `doc_process_switch` | Enable/disable entity extraction during knowledge graph build. |
| `community_detection_switch` | bool | same as `entity_extraction_switch` | Enable/disable community detection during knowledge graph build. |
| `extract_images` | bool | `true` | Run the multimodal LLM on images extracted from documents to generate alt-text. Set to `false` to skip the image-description pass entirely — much faster, at the cost of losing image content from retrieval. Configurable per graph. |
| `min_image_dim_px` | int | `100` | Smallest side (in px) an image must have to be sent to the multimodal LLM. Smaller images are tagged "decorative image" without an LLM call. Configurable per graph. |
| `load_batch_size` | int | `500` | Batch size for document loading. |
| `upsert_delay` | int | `0` | Delay in seconds between loading batches. |
| `default_concurrency` | int | `10` | Base concurrency level for parallel processing. Configurable per graph. |
| `process_interval_seconds` | int | `300` | Interval (seconds) for background consistency processing. |
| `cleanup_interval_seconds` | int | `300` | Interval (seconds) for background cleanup. |
| `checker_batch_size` | int | `100` | Batch size for background consistency checking. |
| `enable_consistency_checker` | bool | `false` | Enable the background consistency checker. |
| `graph_names` | list | `[]` | Graphs to monitor when consistency checker is enabled. |

### Chat History Configuration
Copy the below code into `configs/server_config.json`. You shouldn’t need to change anything unless you change the port of the chat history service in the Docker Compose file.

```json
{
    "chat-history": {
        "apiPort":"8002",
        "dbPath": "chats.db",
        "dbLogPath": "db.log",
        "logPath": "requestLogs.jsonl",
        "conversationAccessRoles": ["superuser", "globaldesigner"]
    }
}
```

### MCP servers (agentic tools)
The agentic chat engine can call external [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) servers as extra tools. Configure them on the **Setup → Server Configuration → MCP Servers** page (**superuser only**). Each server has a **Test** button that connects exactly as the engine will and lists its tools; a server can only be **Saved** after its test passes.

#### Fields

| Field | Applies to | What it is | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Name** | both | Unique label; also the planner's tool prefix (`<name>.<tool>`). No dots. | `weather` |
| **Transport** | both | `http` (recommended) or `stdio`. | `http` |
| **URL** | http | The server's streamable HTTP endpoint. | `https://mcp.example.com/mcp` |
| **Headers** | http | Static headers sent on every request (e.g. auth). Stored masked. | `Authorization` = `Bearer abc123` |
| **Library tarball** | stdio | Filename of a `.tar.gz` in `configs/mcp_servers/` that GraphRAG installs. | `weather_mcp-1.0.tar.gz` |
| **Command** | stdio | The console script the installed package provides, or `python`. | `weather-mcp` |
| **Args** | stdio | Arguments passed to the command. | `-vv` |
| **Env** | stdio | Environment variables for the subprocess. Stored masked. | `WEATHER_API_KEY` = `…` |
| **Allowed tools** | both | Globs of tool names to expose (default `*`). | `get_*, list_*` |
| **Enabled** | both | Off hides the server (and, per-graph, suppresses a same-named global one). | `true` |
| **Forward user** | both | Send the signed-in username to the server (via MCP `_meta`). | `false` |

#### HTTP (recommended)
The MCP server is an **external resource you run and manage yourself** — GraphRAG only needs its URL.

Example — a hosted server that needs an API key:
- **Transport**: `http`
- **URL**: `https://mcp.example.com/mcp`  *(for a server on the same host as GraphRAG, use `http://host.docker.internal:9000/mcp`)*
- **Headers**: `Authorization` = `Bearer abc123`

Click **Test**, then **Save**. Nothing runs inside the GraphRAG container.

#### stdio (Python server run by GraphRAG)
Provide the server as a **source tarball** (`.tar.gz`); GraphRAG installs it (with its dependencies) and launches it by the **console script** the package ships.

1. Get the server's `.tar.gz` — build it with `python -m build` (produces `dist/<name>-<ver>.tar.gz`) or download the sdist from PyPI.
2. In **MCP Servers → Add server**, set **Transport** = `stdio`, then either:
   - click **Upload** next to *Library tarball* to upload the `.tar.gz` (the field auto-fills with its filename), **or**
   - copy the `.tar.gz` into `configs/mcp_servers/` on the host and type the filename in the field.
3. Fill the remaining fields, then **Test** (GraphRAG installs the tarball, launches the command, lists its tools) and **Save**.

Example — a packaged `weather-mcp` server:
- **Transport**: `stdio`
- **Library tarball**: `weather_mcp-1.0.tar.gz`
- **Command**: `weather-mcp`  *(the console script the package registers; if it has none, use **Command** `python` + **Args** `-m, weather_mcp`)*
- **Args**: `-vv`
- **Env**: `WEATHER_API_KEY` = `…`

GraphRAG re-installs the configured tarballs on startup (only those referenced by the MCP config), so they persist across restarts. Uploading is **superuser-only**, since the package runs inside the GraphRAG server.

> Only **Python** servers run under stdio (GraphRAG bundles Python + the MCP SDK). For a server needing another runtime — e.g. a Node `npx` server — run it yourself and connect over **HTTP**.

Servers added under a specific graph override global ones with the same name; setting a per-graph entry to *disabled* suppresses a same-named global server.

## Tuning Guideline

GraphRAG answer quality, latency, and LLM cost are sensitive to a small set of parameters and prompts. This section is a high-level strategy — adjust *one knob at a time*, run the same set of evaluation questions before and after each change, and keep what helps. Detailed parameter descriptions live in [GraphRAG configuration](#graphrag-configuration).

### 1. Tune in the right order

A common mistake is tuning retrieval and prompts before the underlying graph is good. Work bottom-up:

1. **Chunking** — fix how the source documents are split.
2. **Extraction** — fix what entities / relationships are pulled from each chunk.
3. **Retrieval** — pick the right context for each question.
4. **Response prompts** — shape the final answer.

A bad answer at step 4 is rarely fixed by editing the response prompt; usually it's caused by step 1, 2, or 3.

### 2. Chunking — get the granularity right

| Symptom | Likely cause | Tweak |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Answers cite irrelevant facts from elsewhere in the same chunk | chunks too large | drop `chunk_size` (`character` / `markdown` / `html` / `recursive` chunkers); raise `threshold` (`semantic`) so it splits more aggressively |
| Answers miss context that's clearly in the source | chunks too small or no overlap | raise `chunk_size`; bump `overlap_size` (default 1/8 of `chunk_size`); lower `threshold` (`semantic`) |
| Tables / figures get fragmented | wrong chunker for the source | use `markdown` for markdown / docs converted to markdown; use `html` for HTML pages with structure; use `regex` with a custom `pattern` for structured logs |
| Cross-section reasoning fails | no overlap | increase `overlap_size` to ~25% of `chunk_size` |
| Long tables get split mid-row and the answer loses column headers | `chunk_size` (default `2048`) is smaller than the table's serialized length | raise `chunker_config.chunk_size` to fit the largest table whole — for table-heavy regulator / industry reports, **`4096`–`8192` is often the right range** |

Default starting point for prose: `chunker: "semantic"`, `threshold: 0.95`, `chunker_config.method: "percentile"`. Move to `markdown` chunker with `chunk_size: 2048` and `overlap_size: 256` if your source is markdown-heavy and table integrity matters. For corpora dominated by large statistical tables (regulatory reports, fiscal yearbooks, multi-year financial summaries), start with `markdown`/`html` chunker and `chunk_size: 8192` so each table stays in one chunk.

### 3. Extraction — make the graph clean before tuning retrieval

The extraction prompt drives what becomes a vertex / edge. Two failure modes show up:

- **Document-structure noise** — the graph fills up with layout artifacts (page numbers, section headers, table captions, chart labels) instead of domain entities. This crushes downstream retrieval because the LLM has to wade through structural junk.
- **Generic abstractions** — over-merged or under-specified buckets (e.g. an "entity" or "record" type that swallows everything) instead of the concrete domain types you actually care about. For example, in a financial corpus you want `Company`, `Fund`, `Account`, `Person`, `Filing`, `Risk` — not a single `record` bin.

Today's primary lever is the **entity-extraction prompt**:

- **Customize the prompt for your domain** via Settings → *Customize Prompts* → entity extraction. Tell the LLM explicitly what counts and what doesn't. For a financial domain: *"Extract concrete real-world entities (companies, people, funds, accounts, filings, transactions, risks). Ignore document layout (page numbers, headers/footers, tables, captions, figures, navigation menus)."*
- **Add 1–2 short domain examples** in the prompt. Even one well-chosen exemplar (an extracted entity with type and definition) dramatically improves consistency across chunks.
- **List the canonical edge verbs you want.** Encourage `PUBLISHES`, `OWNS`, `ISSUES`, `MANAGES`, `REPORTS_ON` in the relationship-extraction prompt rather than letting the LLM emit ad-hoc nominal phrases.

If extraction quality is still poor after iterating on the prompt, declare a domain schema up front via the *Initialize Knowledge Graph* dialog (paste GSQL, or generate a draft from sample documents) so extraction populates the types you actually want instead of growing them organically from what the LLM happens to emit. See the Configuration table above for `strict_mode` and `retrieval_include_entity` for the schema-aware behavior knobs.

**Note on LLM faithfulness.** Entity, relationship, and attribute extraction is best-effort and may include occasional errors, especially for well-known entities. For high-stakes applications, validate critical extracted values against your source documents before relying on them.

### 4. Retrieval — match context size to the question

> In the **Agentic** engine the agent chooses the retrieval method itself, so the *method-selection* guidance in this section (e.g. "use Community Search for aggregation") applies to the **Classic** engine. The size knobs below (`top_k`, `num_hops`, `max_results`, `community_level`, …) still bound and default the retrievers in **both** engines, so they're worth tuning regardless of which engine you run.

Three knobs interact: `top_k`, `num_hops`, `num_seen_min`. Also `chunk_only` / `doc_only` and (for community search) `community_level` / `with_chunk`.

| Question style | Recommended start | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *"What is X?"* (specific lookup) | `top_k=3`, `num_hops=1`, `num_seen_min=1` | Tight neighborhood, few seeds. |
| *"How are X and Y related?"* (relational) | `top_k=5`, `num_hops=2`, `num_seen_min=1` | Need to traverse between concepts. |
| *"Summarize the report"* (broad) | `top_k=8`, `num_hops=2`, `num_seen_min=2` | More seeds, filter loose connections. |
| *"Compare A across multiple sections"* (multi-hop reasoning) | `top_k=8`, `num_hops=3`, `num_seen_min=2` | Wide traversal, but tighten the filter. |
| *"List all X"* (aggregation) | use *Community Search* with `community_level: 1–2` | Broader summaries, not chunk-level retrieval. |

Heuristics:

- If the answer is **vague or hallucinated**, you don't have enough context: raise `top_k` first, then `num_hops`.
- If the answer is **drowning in irrelevant detail**, you have too much: drop `top_k`, raise `num_seen_min`, or set `chunk_only: true`.
- If the answer **misses things across sections**, raise `num_hops` (1 → 2 → 3). Each extra hop multiplies result size, so don't go past 3 without strong evidence.
- If the answer **cites whole documents but loses chunk-level detail**, set `doc_only: false` and `chunk_only: true`.
- For broad-survey questions, prefer `community_search` over hybrid; tune `community_level` (lower = more granular communities, higher = broader summaries).

Each tweak should be made **alone** — moving `top_k` and `num_hops` together makes it impossible to tell which one helped.

### 5. Prompts — last resort, biggest leverage when the rest is right

Customize prompts via the UI: *Settings → Customize Prompts*. Customization is **additive** — you edit an instructions-and-examples layer that is appended to fixed, non-editable rules, so a customization extends behavior without dropping the rules that keep the prompt working. The customizable prompt groups (UI labels and underlying ids):

- **Entity Relationships** (`entity_relationship`) — combined entity- and relationship-extraction prompt; controls what becomes a vertex / edge. Tune for noise suppression, domain specificity, and verb-form edge names (e.g. `PUBLISHES`, `OWNS`, `MANAGES` instead of nominal phrases). See §3.
- **Schema Instructions** (`query_generation`) — instructions used when generating GSQL / Cypher and when filtering the schema for a structured query. Tune if your domain has unusual type names that aren't matching user phrasing, or if generated queries miss obvious joins.
- **Community Summarization** (`community_summarization`) — how community summaries are produced during knowledge-graph build. Tune for length / tone and to bias summaries toward domain-specific framing.
- **Chatbot Responses** (`chatbot_response`) — the final answer template. Keep it short; the LLM responds best to clear constraints (*"answer in ≤3 sentences, cite the doc id"*).
- **Agentic Planner** (`agentic_planner`) and **React Agent** (`agentic_agent`) — the retrieval strategy for each agentic engine: which methods to use, when, and in what order. The role and act model stay fixed.
- **Agent Routing** (`agentic_triage`) — the policy that decides whether a message is answered directly (greetings, questions about the assistant) or sent to the agent to retrieve / use a tool.

When customizing:

- **Always start from the system default** (don't write from scratch).
- **Keep examples short and domain-relevant.**
- **Test with the same evaluation set** before and after — a prompt change that fixes one question often regresses another.
- **Know where overrides live.** The runtime resolves prompt files in this order:
  1. Graph-scoped: `configs/graph_configs/<graphname>/prompts/<filename>.txt` — created when you edit prompts with a specific graph selected. Highest priority.
  2. Global override: `configs/prompts/<filename>.txt` — created when you edit prompts globally and the bundled provider default path is read-only.
  3. Provider default (bundled): `./common/prompts/<provider>/<filename>.txt` — selected by the `prompt_path` field in the LLM config. Shipped with the deployment.
- **Version-control the override directories** so they survive container rebuilds and travel with the deployment.
- **Delete custom prompt overrides** if you suspect they're stale; the system falls back to the next layer cleanly.

### 6. Performance / cost knobs

- **`default_concurrency`** drives all internal semaphores. ECC uses 2× this value for ingest workers; the chatbot uses 1×. Raise it to speed up ingestion of large corpora; lower it if you're hitting LLM rate limits or seeing socket exhaustion.
- **`reuse_embedding: true`** skips re-embedding identical text — major saving on re-ingest of unchanged documents.
- **Choose `llm_model` thoughtfully** — entity / relationship extraction tolerates cheaper / faster models (Haiku, Nova-lite, Flash); response synthesis benefits from stronger ones (Sonnet, GPT-4-class). The `multimodal_service` is independent — set it to a vision-capable model only when you actually ingest images.
- **`load_batch_size`** and **`upsert_delay`** control ingestion pressure on TigerGraph. Defaults are fine for most loads; lower the batch size if you see write timeouts.
- **Image-description speed.** On image-heavy documents, every image is sent to the multimodal LLM, which dominates ingest time. Tune via `graphrag_config` (global or per graph) — both knobs are also editable from the *GraphRAG Configuration* page in the UI:
    - `extract_images` (default `true`) — set to `false` to skip image description entirely.
    - `min_image_dim_px` (default `100`) — smaller images are tagged "decorative image" without an LLM call.
    - Multimodal calls share the same `default_concurrency` semaphore as the rest of the pipeline — raise it to parallelize more describe calls; lower it if the multimodal provider's rate limit is hit.
    - AWS Bedrock users can further tune connection pool sizing via `boto3_config` in `llm_config`.

### 7. A working tuning loop

1. Define **5–10 representative evaluation questions** with expected answers (or at least the docs that should ground them).
2. Establish a **baseline** — run all questions, save answers + retrieved chunks.
3. **Change one parameter** (or one prompt). Re-run.
4. Diff the answers. Keep the change only if it improves more questions than it regresses.
5. **Iterate in order** — chunking → extraction → retrieval → prompts. Don't skip ahead.
6. **Save the winning config** to `configs/server_config.json` and document the rationale in your team's runbook.

The chatbot UI's *Explain* panel (which lists the chunks fed into the answer) is the fastest debugging tool — most quality issues become obvious by reading the chunks the system actually retrieved.

## Customization and Extensibility
TigerGraph GraphRAG is designed to be easily extensible. The service can be configured to use different LLM providers, different graph schemas, and different LangChain tools. The service can also be extended to use different embedding services, different LLM generation services, and different LangChain tools. For more information on how to extend the service, see the [Developer Guide](./docs/DeveloperGuide.md).

### Test Your Code Changes

Unit and integration tests live under `graphrag/tests`. Run them with pytest from the service directory, in an environment that has the service dependencies installed — the simplest is inside the built `graphrag` image, which already bundles them:

```sh
cd graphrag
python -m pytest
```

Run a single suite while iterating, e.g.:

```sh
python -m pytest graphrag/tests/test_schema_utils.py -q
```

To exercise a change against a live stack, bring the services up with the compose file and run the tests against them:

```sh
docker compose up -d --build
```

> **Windows developers:** the repo's top-level `configs/nginx.conf` and `configs/server_config.json` are symlinks intended for POSIX shells and don't resolve on Windows. Before running `docker compose up -d` from the repo root, overwrite them with the tutorial copies:
> ```sh
> cp docs/tutorials/configs/nginx.conf configs/nginx.conf
> cp docs/tutorials/configs/server_config.json configs/server_config.json
> ```

For adding a new test suite and the broader developer workflow — extending the service with different LLM providers, embedding services, or tools — see the [Developer Guide](./docs/DeveloperGuide.md).
