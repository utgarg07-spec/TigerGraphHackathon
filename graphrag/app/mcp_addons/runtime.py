"""Sync ↔ async bridge for the external MCP client manager.

The agentic executor is sync — it calls registered tool functions
directly. The MCP SDK is async, and the manager's connections (long-lived
stdio subprocesses and HTTP sessions) keep ``asyncio.Lock`` instances and
streams bound to whichever event loop opened them. So per-call
``asyncio.run`` is wrong: each call would create a new loop, and the next
call would find locks bound to a dead one.

This module owns a dedicated background event loop thread. ``run_sync``
schedules a coroutine onto it and blocks for the result; ``run_async``
returns an awaitable for callers inside FastAPI's main loop. Every MCP
operation goes through this loop, so the manager's async state is
consistent across calls and across threads.
