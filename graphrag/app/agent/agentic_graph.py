"""Agentic orchestration: plan -> execute -> (evaluate & maybe extend) ->
synthesize.

Implemented as a bounded control loop rather than a LangGraph StateGraph —
the flow is linear with a single replan loop, so a plain loop is clearer
and fully testable. The classic engine keeps its LangGraph; this one can
adopt LangGraph later if checkpointing/streaming-graph features are needed.
