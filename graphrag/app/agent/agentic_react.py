"""Agentic react orchestrator — free tool-calling loop.

The configured chat model freely calls registry tools in a reason-act loop:
each iteration is one LLM round-trip that may emit zero or more tool calls,
whose results are fed back as ``ToolMessage`` observations on the next
iteration. The loop ends when the model answers without tool calls, or
when the per-graph iteration cap is hit.

This is the alternative to the planner→executor engine in
``agentic_graph.run_agentic``; both are reachable from ``AgenticAgent``
based on ``graphrag_config.agent_style`` (default ``"planned"``).
