"""Unit tests for the schema-aware extension of
``LLMEntityRelationshipExtractor`` — definitions are surfaced in the
prompt without breaking the legacy ``allowed_*_types`` arguments.

We do not invoke the LLM. The tests exercise prompt assembly in
``adocument_er_extraction`` / ``document_er_extraction`` by capturing
the messages passed to ``ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages``.
