"""Unit tests for ``common.db.retriever_render``.

The renderer rewrites stable string anchors in the retriever GSQL
files so domain-VT instances are reachable via their own edges and
walked alongside Entity in the community queries. Tests assert the
substitutions land where expected and that empty domain sets pass the
body through unchanged.
