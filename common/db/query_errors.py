"""Helpers for interpreting TigerGraph query create/install results and errors.

The query REST API (``createQuery``) distinguishes a TigerGraph query error
(the body failed type/semantic checks and was saved as a draft) from an
HTTP/transport failure, and GSQL error blobs need compressing for display.
These helpers centralize that interpretation so every caller (the Migration
Assistant, the ECC rebuild, …) shares one implementation.

For detecting whether a ``conn.gsql()`` result string reports failure, use
``common.db.schema_utils.gsql_output_error`` (the established helper) — not a
second copy here.

    GSQL emits ``<Type|Semantic> Check Error in query X (CODE): line N, col M``

    that reason are returned together.
