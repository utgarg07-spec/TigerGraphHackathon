"""Content-aware chunker dispatcher.

When ``graphrag_config.chunker = "auto"`` is set on a graph, the ECC
worker instantiates an ``AutoChunker``. For each document passed to
``chunk()``, the dispatcher inspects the content's structural density
and delegates to the most appropriate concrete chunker:

  - HTML tags present (``<html>``, ``<body>``, ``<table>``, ``<h1>``…)
    → ``structured`` chunker (HTML-aware atomic blocks, heading folding)

  - Markdown structure present (multiple ``|...|`` tables, several
    ``![alt](url)`` figures, embedded ``<!-- PAGE N -->`` markers from
    pymupdf4llm) → ``structured`` chunker

  - Several markdown headings but no table / figure / page signals
    → ``markdown`` chunker (heading-aware section splitter)

  - No structure signals → ``semantic`` chunker (LLM-embedding-based
    coherent splitting)

Delegate chunkers are lazily instantiated and cached, so a graph
ingesting 50 markdown documents only instantiates one ``StructuredChunker``.
