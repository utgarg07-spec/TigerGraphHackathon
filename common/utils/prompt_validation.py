"""Gatekeepers for user-customized prompt templates.

When a user saves a customized prompt via the *Customize Prompts* UI,
two things must hold before the file is written:

1. **Required placeholders are present.** Every prompt type has a fixed
   set of ``{var}`` tokens the calling code substitutes at runtime
   (e.g. ``community_summarization`` always interpolates
   ``{entity_name}`` and ``{description_list}``). If the user removes
   one of these, the corresponding feature breaks at the next call.
   ``validate_and_escape_prompt`` returns the missing list so the API
   can reject the save with a 400.

2. **Stray brace tokens are escaped.** Users frequently include literal
   ``{example}`` or ``{TODO}`` text in their prompts as documentation
   or examples. ``str.format`` / ``PromptTemplate`` interpret those as
   placeholders and either substitute the wrong thing or raise
   ``KeyError``. ``validate_and_escape_prompt`` rewrites any
   ``{ident}`` whose name isn't a recognized placeholder for the
   prompt type into ``{{ident}}`` so the runtime treats it as literal.

The placeholder sets are derived from ``input_variables=[…]`` at the
caller site (e.g. ``agent_generation.py``, ``community_summarizer.py``,
``map_question_to_schema.py``). Add a new entry here when a new
user-customizable prompt is wired up.
